[{"content":"Hi there! I\u0026rsquo;m Dan.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve always liked to write. I picked up a journaling habit a few years ago, and I\u0026rsquo;ve been regularly recording my ruminations ever since. Peoples' minds work through lots of interesting thoughts and problems throughout their lives. Most go unrecorded, and I think that\u0026rsquo;s a tragedy.\nI\u0026rsquo;m interested in lots of things\u0026ndash;mathematics, computer science, philosophy, music, and art, to name the big ones. I enjoy writing about these subjects in isolation, but I especially enjoy writing about the strange, surprising, and often beautiful ways in which they interact or translate to one another (isomorphisms, of sorts).\nOutside of these interests, I enjoy mountaineering, skiing, and botany. I\u0026rsquo;m slowly working my way through the Colorado 14ers, and my collection of carnivorous plants continues to grow! I currently work at Jane Street Capital and am based out of New York City.\n","permalink":"https://isomorphic.group/about/","summary":"Hi there!
