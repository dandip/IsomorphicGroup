Hi there! I'm Dan.

I've always liked to write. I picked up a journaling habit a few years ago,
and I've been regularly recording my ruminations ever since. Peoples'
minds work through lots of interesting thoughts and problems throughout their
lives. Most go unrecorded, and I think that's a tragedy.

I'm interested in lots of things--mathematics, computer science, philosophy, music, and art, to name the big ones. I enjoy writing about these subjects in isolation, but I especially enjoy writing about the strange, surprising, and often beautiful ways in which they interact or
translate to one another (isomorphisms, of sorts).

Outside of these interests, I enjoy mountaineering, skiing, and botany. I'm slowly working my way
through the Colorado 14ers, and my collection of carnivorous plants continues to grow! I currently work at Jane Street Capital and am based out of New York City.
